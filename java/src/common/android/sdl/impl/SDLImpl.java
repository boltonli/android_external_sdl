	 * 
	 * If SDL_ANYFORMAT is set in 'flags', the SDL library will try to set the
	 * requested bits-per-pixel, but will return whatever video pixel format is
	 * available. The default is to emulate the requested pixel format if it is
	 * not natively available.
	 * 
	 * If SDL_HWSURFACE is set in 'flags', the video surface will be placed in
	 * video memory, if possible, and you may have to call SDL_LockSurface() in
	 * order to access the raw framebuffer. Otherwise, the video surface will be
	 * created in system memory.
	 * 
	 * If SDL_ASYNCBLIT is set in 'flags', SDL will try to perform rectangle
	 * updates asynchronously, but you must always lock before accessing pixels.
	 * SDL will wait for updates to complete before returning from the lock.
	 * 
	 * If SDL_HWPALETTE is set in 'flags', the SDL library will guarantee that
	 * the colors set by SDL_SetColors() will be the colors you get. Otherwise,
	 * in 8-bit mode, SDL_SetColors() may not be able to set all of the colors
	 * exactly the way they are requested, and you should look at the video
	 * surface structure to determine the actual palette. If SDL cannot
	 * guarantee that the colors you request can be set, i.e. if the colormap is
	 * shared, then the video surface may be created under emulation in system
	 * memory, overriding the SDL_HWSURFACE flag.
	 * 
	 * If SDL_FULLSCREEN is set in 'flags', the SDL library will try to set a
	 * fullscreen video mode. The default is to create a windowed mode if the
	 * current graphics system has a window manager. If the SDL library is able
	 * to set a fullscreen video mode, this flag will be set in the surface that
	 * is returned.
	 * 
	 * If SDL_DOUBLEBUF is set in 'flags', the SDL library will try to set up
	 * two surfaces in video memory and swap between them when you call
	 * SDL_Flip(). This is usually slower than the normal single-buffering
	 * scheme, but prevents "tearing" artifacts caused by modifying video memory
	 * while the monitor is refreshing. It should only be used by applications
	 * that redraw the entire screen on every update.
	 * 
	 * If SDL_RESIZABLE is set in 'flags', the SDL library will allow the window
	 * manager, if any, to resize the window at runtime. When this occurs, SDL
	 * will send a SDL_VIDEORESIZE event to you application, and you must
	 * respond to the event by re-calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with the requested
	 * size (or another size that suits the application).
	 * 
	 * If SDL_NOFRAME is set in 'flags', the SDL library will create a window
	 * without any title bar or frame decoration. Fullscreen video modes have
	 * this flag set automatically.
	 * 
	 * This function returns the video framebuffer surface, or NULL if it fails.
	 * 
	 * If you rely on functionality provided by certain video flags, check the
	 * flags of the returned surface to make sure that functionality is
	 * available. SDL will fall back to reduced functionality if the exact flags
	 * you wanted are not available.
